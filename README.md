Lung Cancer Prediction Project
Project Description
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict lung cancer based on patient data. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training to achieve accurate cancer prediction. The project compares different machine learning models and evaluates their performance using appropriate metrics. The primary goal is to create a reliable system that can assist in early lung cancer detection, aiding medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Known Issues & Future Plans
Known Issues
Predictions may have slight inaccuracies due to imbalanced datasets or missing critical features.
The model may require further tuning to improve recall for detecting cancer cases.
Real-time predictions could require optimization for speed and efficiency.

Future Plans
Implement a deep learning-based approach (CNNs or LSTMs) for better accuracy and robustness.
Deploy the model as a web-based or mobile application for real-world usability.
Expand the dataset to include more diverse patient demographics and medical histories.
Integrate additional medical imaging data (CT scans, X-rays) for enhanced prediction.
