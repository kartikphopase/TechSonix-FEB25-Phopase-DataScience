Hand Gesture Detection Project
Project Description
  This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect and classify hand gestures using a dataset of hand gesture images. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training to achieve accurate gesture recognition. The project compares different machine learning models and evaluates their performance using appropriate metrics. The primary goal is to create a reliable system that can interpret hand movements for applications such as sign language recognition, gaming controls, and human-computer interaction.
